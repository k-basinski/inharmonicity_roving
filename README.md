To replicate the results, run scripts in the indicated order. Scripts 00-03 require a parameter (participant ID) to work.

Alternatively, you can download the `all.p` from the raw data repository. This file contains preprocessed evoked responses stored as a Python dict. Scripts from 05 onwards use this file for analysis and plotting.
